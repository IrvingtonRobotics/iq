                <strong>VEX IQ Challenge</strong>, presented by the
                <strong>Robotics Education & Competition (REC) Foundation
                </strong>, provides students as young as eight with exciting,
                <strong>open-ended robotics engineering and research challenges</strong> that engage students and enhance their science,
                technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) skills through hands-on, student-centered learning. The VEX
                IQ Challenge fosters student development of
                <strong>teamwork, collaboration, critical thinking, project management, and communication skills</strong> required
                to prepare them to become the
                <strong>next generation of innovators and problem solvers</strong>. The VEX IQ Challenge was designed to provide
                students with an opportunity to solve exciting robot game challenges by building and designing a robot with
                easy to use, snap together components for use on a portable game field.

                        <em>VEX IQ Challenge Ringmaster</em> is played on a 4’ x 8’ rectangular field. Two robots compete in
                        the
                        <em>Teamwork Challenge</em> as an alliance in 60-second long teamwork matches, working collaboratively
                        to score points. Teams also compete in the
                        <em>Robot Skills Challenge</em> where one robot takes the field to score as many points as possible.
                        These matches consist of
                        <em>Driving Skills</em>
                        Matches, which will be entirely driver controlled, and
                        <em>Programming Skills Matches</em>, which will be autonomous with limited human interaction.
